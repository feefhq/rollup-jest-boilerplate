# rollup-jest-boilerplate

A really simple boilerplate to demonstrate Jest unit testing with a Rollup project.

All it does is demonstrate the ability to test a project which uses ES modules for both source and tests. Babel is used to transform test files, and Rollup is used for a build task.

I've deliberately kept this very simple, to help demonstrate the dependencies and configuration required to get basic Jest unit tests working for a project built using Rollup.
